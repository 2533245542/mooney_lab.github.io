Welcome to the Mooney Lab! We focuse on built environment influences on pedestrian injury and physical activity, augmented with a stable of side projects digging into epidemiologic methodology. The lab is in the [Department of Epidemiology ](https://epi.washington.edu/) at University of Washington.
